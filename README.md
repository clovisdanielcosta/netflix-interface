## :small_orange_diamond: Sharing

  To inject elements in your file HTML using javascript you could take a look in this code below. You just need put the function "showTrailer(1)" on onclick event in yours buttons or anchors. Don't forget pass the parameter of movie selected inside of parenthesis in the function:

  ```javascript

  //Function to switch between movies and show just section trailers
  function showTrailer(movieReceived) {
    var trailer = "";
    var wrapper = document.createElement("div");
    vMain.style.display = "none";
    vCarousel.style.display = "none";
    vTrailer.style.display = "block";
    switch (movieReceived) {
        case 1: trailer = "TTIbWKEUPnc"; break;
        case 2: trailer = "ZwrS0dJZ-9A"; break;
        case 3: trailer = "Z1xIeP7irVo"; break;
        case 4: trailer = "MblpkLSSvjM"; break;
        case 5: trailer = "sCZFxgsg86k"; break;
        case 6: trailer = "zQEjE_M2Esw"; break;
        case 7: trailer = "rcV1I-397Wg"; break;
        case 8: trailer = "AD5cvVk-4Ps"; break;
        case 9: trailer = "Bmw6VOj9igY"; break;
        case 10: trailer = "9ozuNGDDGM0"; break;
        default: trailer = "Bb9TnVa2aIA"; break;
    }
    //Injecting element iframe in section trailers
    wrapper.innerHTML = `\
    <iframe width="875" height="366" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/${trailer}" \
    frameborder="0" \
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" \
    allowfullscreen>\
    </iframe>`;
    document.body.appendChild(wrapper);
  }

  ```

## :small_orange_diamond: Customizing

  - Applied my own pattern of folders structure and filenames. 
  - Personal choose of fonts and colors.
  - Use of CSS display.style to hide and show sections which minimize add of extra pages on project. 
  - Use of video on open page to make user experience more comfortable.
  - Use of injection elements html by javascript doing a catch the code of movie selected.
